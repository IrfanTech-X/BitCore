# 🧠 BitCore – Binary Arithmetic Logic Unit Simulator

> A minimal ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) simulation written in Java  
> Developed for the **Computer Architecture Course**  


---

## 📌 Overview

**BitCore** (formerly BinaryALU) is a Java-based command-line simulation of a basic **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**. It is designed to perform core binary arithmetic and logic operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND/OR/XOR/NOT, and bit shifting.

The project was developed for academic purposes to help students understand how a CPU handles binary data at a low level. BitCore simulates simplified ALU behavior without using built-in math libraries, offering a hands-on approach to fundamental computer architecture concepts.

- ↔️ Bit shifting: Left Shift, Right Shift  
- 🚫 Overflow and carry detection  
- 🎯 Binary input validation  
- 🎛️ Command-line interface with interactive prompts  
- 📦 Modular structure using separate ALU and utility classes

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

---
git clone https://github.com/IrfanTech-X/BitCore.git
cd BitCore
2️⃣ Open in IDE
Open the folder in NetBeans, IntelliJ, or any Java IDE.

3️⃣ Run the Application
Run the BitCore.java file.

Follow the on-screen instructions in the terminal.


📌 Limitations
Supports only 8-bit binary numbers in current version

Signed binary and 2’s complement not yet implemented

CLI-based only (no GUI)

🎯 Learning Objectives
Simulate ALU operations using binary inputs

Understand binary arithmetic and bitwise logic

Practice input validation and string parsing in Java

Learn about low-level computation in a high-level language

Apply OOP concepts to structure logic-based projects
